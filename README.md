# PrivatePost 🛡️

PrivatePost is a secure backend API built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**, designed for user authentication and private post management. It allows users to sign up, log in, and create posts that are only visible to them. Security is handled via **password encryption**, **HTTP-only cookies**, and **protected routes**. All endpoints are testable using **Postman**.
